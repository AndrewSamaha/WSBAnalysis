# WSBAnalysis
An analysis of posts on r/WallStreetBets

I'm interested in understanding posting and post-popularity in WallStreetBets. WallStreetBets is online community of individual and often unruly investors. Their communication style is meme-driven and often provocative. Their elevate underdogs and denegrate the financial establishment. When they act as a group, they can have surprising effects on the market, e.g., Game Stop.

# The Dataset
<% first,last = getdaterange() %>
As of <%print(datetime.date.today().strftime('%m/%d/%y'))%>, the dataset consisted of <%= getnumsubmissions() %> submissions to r/WallStreetBets from a period of <%= round(get_days(),1) %> days beginning <%print(first['date'].strftime('%m/%d/%y'))%> and ending <%print(last['date'].strftime('%m/%d/%y'))%>. These were scraped using the Reddit API and a tool I developed, [WSBScraper](https://github.com/AndrewSamaha/WSBScraper), which saves posts to a MongoDB.

A Sample:
```
{ 
    "_id" : ObjectId("605bb15d5df7eedfb49c1b8d"), 
    "id" : "mchdcf", 
    "fullname" : "t3_mchdcf", 
    "selftext" : "", 
    "created_utc" : "2021-03-24 17:36:29", 
    "num_comments" : 2, 
    "score" : 7, 
    "upvote_ratio" : 1, 
    "is_original_content" : false, 
    "permalink" : "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mchdcf/im_an_abe_and_i_eat_crayons_keeping_those_gme/", 
    "title" : "I‚Äôm an abe ü¶ç and I eat crayons üñç Keeping those GME contracts because selling is a loss all in its own! 17K down and still holding strong!",

# Questions
For this analysis, I focused on four questions:
1. When do people post?
1. Who posts?
1. What relationships exist between Reddit's various post-popularity metrics?
1. What makes for a popular post?

# When do people post?
Figure 1, below, shows the total number of posts for each hour. The x-axis is hours in January 1st, 2021 and the y-axis shows the count in each of the plotted hours. Note the extreme outlier -- those took place during a four-hour period on March 24th, 2021 (shortly after 2000 hours on the graph below).<br>
![Figure 1](figures/posts_per_hour.png)
<% posts_per_hour(['figures/posts_per_hour.png','figures/avg_posts_per_hour.png']) %>

Figure 2, below, shows the same data aggregated across hours plotted with 95% bootstrapped confidence bands (60k resamples each hour). Note the intra-day pattern, with the lowest frequency of posts occurring between midnight and 9AM UTC. Also note the peak, which appears at 16 UTC or between 4-5pm EST, one hour before market close.<br>
![Figure 2](figures/avg_posts_per_hour.png)

<% getsubmissiondeltas(save='figures/submissiondeltas.png') %>
Below is a histogram of submission deltas (seconds between posts) plotted with a log y-axis. As can be seen in the figure, the majority of the posts occur less than 5,000 seconds apart, or ~83 minutes. 

![Figure 3](figures/submissiondeltas.png)


Removing deltas above 5000 gives us a smooth distribution that we can plot in arithmatic space:<br>
![Figure 4](figures/submissiondeltas_clean.png)
<% getsubmissiondeltas(max=5000,log=False,save='figures/submissiondeltas_clean.png') %>

Also, it's worth examining the left-side of the distribution more closely to make sure the geometric shape still holds true at shorter deltas.<br>
![Figure 5](figures/submissiondeltas_left.png)
<% getsubmissiondeltas(max=200,log=False,save='figures/submissiondeltas_left.png') %>

These data show that the most frequently-occurring interval between submissions is 20 s or less. And it roughly follows an exponential decline, suggesting that post occurrences could be modeled as independent and randomly occurring events.

# Who posts?

A total of <% 
(num, b, c, d) = get_authors() 
print(num)
%> submission authors are represented in the data. The plot below shows a histogram of the authors ranked from most to lease posts. Note the vast majority of posters only posted once during the time period. Conversely, a minority of posters contributed 6 or more posts.

# What relationships exist between Reddit's various post-popularity metrics?

<% fig_field_by_field('num_comments','score',save=True) %>

These figures show the relationship between a submission's score and the number of comments it's received. The figure seems to show three clusters of data points. For now, let's focus on those happening in scores less than 2000, as this seems to be the majority of submissions (<%= round(count({'score': {'$lte':2000}})*100/count({})) %>%) and it looks like there might be a postive correlation between the two.

<% fig_field_by_field('num_comments','upvote_ratio',logx=True,xmin=1,median=True,mean=True,save=True) %>
The relationship between score and upvote ratio is a monotonicly incresing, negatively accelerated function.

<% fig_field_by_field('score','upvote_ratio',xmin=1,logx=True,mean=True,median=True,save=True) %>
Interestingly, the relationship between upvote ratio and score is bitonic, which is to say that score and upvote ratio increase together and then at some point, that relationship reverses: For example, posts with the most up votes are likely to have a higher proportion of down votes than posts with only somewhat fewer upvotes. Perhaps posts that attract the most upvotes are exceptionally controversial, and therefore likely to obtain proportionally fewer votes than slightly less popular posts. Or maybe, as posts become more popular, they attract more dissenters and contrarians.


# What makes for a popular post?
Here, I was interesting in two questions that felt intuitively likely:
1. Are older posts more popular?

<% fig_field_by_age('score',save=True,ymin=1,logy=True, ymedian=True, ymean=True) %>


<% fig_field_by_age('upvote_ratio',save=True,ymedian=True, ymean=True) %>


<% fig_field_by_age('num_comments',ymin=1,logy=True,save=True, ymedian=True, ymean=True) %>

1. Are posts by more frequently posters more popular?
<% compare_posters() %>


No.


# Results Summary
For this analysis, I focused on four questions:
1. When do people post?
On most days, there are between 0 and 14 posts per hour, with most posts happening in the hour before the close of trading in US markets (4-5pm EST).
2. Who posts?
Most posters created only one post during the obversaion window, with only a minority of posters creating more than 6 posts.
3. What relationships exist between Reddit's various post-popularity metrics?
Most of Reddit's post-popularity metrics are positively correlated and monotonic, with an exception being the relaltionship between upvote ratio and score.
4. What makes for a popular post?
Two of the most intuitively likely candidates (post age and the productivity of the poster) had no clear reltaionship with post productivity.

# Future Directions
In the future, I'm interested in:
1. Content Analyses -- The current analysis was contain naive, future analyses could examine content (images/text) to see if can be used to predict popularity, to examine meme references, and stock ticker mentions.
2. Relationships to other datasets, e.g., do stock price swings predict discussions on Reddit, or vice-versa?
3. Post life cycle -- It might be interesting to examine post popularity over time to identify if post-popularity metrics within the first few hours or minutes of a post predict asympototic popularity.
